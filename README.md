# H1 Line Emission

## Overview

The H1 Line Emission project explores the significance of the hydrogen line in radio astronomy. This README provides an overview of the experiment, its methodologies, and the contents of the repository.

## Introduction

Hydrogen, the most abundant element in the universe, emits the hydrogen lineâ€”a critical spectral line in radio astronomy. The 21 cm hydrogen line, emitted by atomic hydrogen, has a frequency of approximately 1420.4057 MHz or 21.1 cm. Its significance lies in its ability to reveal essential details about celestial bodies, aiding in our understanding of the cosmos.

## Experiment Setup

The H1 Line experiment utilizes a horn antenna for its superior performance, particularly in noise reduction compared to parabolic dish antennas. Connected to Low Noise Amplifiers and a Bandpass Filter, the horn antenna ensures precise data collection and transmission.

### Procedures

1. **Temperature Calculation:** The initial step involves determining the temperature of celestial bodies by plotting power against frequency. This data is fundamental for further analyses.

2. **Velocity Calibration:** After establishing temperatures, velocity calibration is conducted with respect to the local standard of rest. This calibration ensures accurate interpretation of the data.

3. **Data Visualization:** Finally, calibrated temperatures are visualized and analyzed against velocities.

## Contents

The repository includes:

- **CSV Datasets:** Recorded along the galactic center with a 20-unit difference.
- **Jupyter Notebook (IPYNB):** Contains visualizations.
- **PDF Report:** Provides detailed analysis.
