# H1_line_emission

Hydrogen, being the most abundant element in the universe, makes the hydrogen line a pivotal component in radio astronomy. 
The 21 cm hydrogen line, emitted by atomic hydrogen, is a spectral line with a frequency of approximately 1420.4057 MHz or 21.1 cm.
This line's significance lies in its ability to reveal crucial details about celestial bodies, aiding us in unraveling the mysteries of the cosmos.

The H1_line experiment employs a horn antenna due to its superior performance, especially in terms of noise reduction, 
when compared to parabolic dish antennas. Connected to Low Noise Amplifiers and a Bandpass Filter,
the horn antenna facilitates precise data collection and transmission.

Temperature Calculation: The initial step involves determining the temperature of celestial bodies by plotting power against frequency. This crucial data forms the foundation for our further analyses.

Velocity Calibration: Once the temperatures are established, we proceed to calibrate velocities with respect to the local standard of rest. This calibration is essential for accurate and meaningful interpretation of the data.

Data Visualization: Finally, we visualize and analyze the calibrated temperatures against the velocities, unraveling the intricate dance of celestial bodies along the galactic equator.
